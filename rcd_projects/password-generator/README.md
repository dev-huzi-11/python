- Adjustable password length.
- Option to include/exclude numbers, symbols, and uppercase/lowercase letters.
- Simple and interactive UI built with Streamlit.
- Lightweight and fast execution.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Streamlit**: For building the user interface.
- **UV**: Used for efficient and fast execution.

## Installation

1. Create a new folder for the project:
   ```bash
   mkdir password-generator
   cd password-generator

2. Initialize a UV environment:
   ```bash
   uv init password-generator
   cd password-generator
   ```

3. Install Streamlit:
   ```bash
   uv add streamlit
   ```

4. Activate the environment:
   - If using **Git Bash**:
     ```bash
     source .venv/Scripts/activate
     ```
   - If using **Command Prompt (CMD)**:
     ```cmd
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - If using **PowerShell**:
     ```powershell
     .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```

## Usage
