# Assignment: Python Data Structures & Loops

## Overview

I have successfully completed this assignment, which helped me learn and understand essential Python data structures and loops. I explored Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets, and Frozen Sets, along with mastering different looping techniques in Python.

## Topics Covered

1. **Loops in Python**

   - For Loop
   - While Loop
   - Nested Loops
   - Break & Continue Statements

2. **Dictionaries**

   - Creating a Dictionary
   - Accessing, Modifying & Deleting Items
   - Dictionary Methods (keys, values, items, get, update, pop, popitem, clear, etc.)
   - Nested Dictionaries
   - Dictionary Comprehension

3. **Lists**

   - Creating a List
   - Accessing Elements (Indexing & Slicing)
   - Adding, Removing, and Modifying Elements
   - List Methods (append, remove, pop, sort, reverse, etc.)
   - List Comprehension

4. **Tuples**

   - Creating Tuples
   - Accessing Elements
   - Tuple Operations (Indexing, Slicing, Concatenation, Repetition)
   - Tuple Methods (count, index)
   - Packing & Unpacking Tuples

5. **Sets & Frozen Sets**

   - Creating Sets
   - Set Operations (Union, Intersection, Difference, Symmetric Difference)
   - Adding & Removing Elements in a Set
   - Set Methods (add, remove, discard, pop, clear)
   - Frozen Sets (Immutable Sets)

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this assignment, I have:

- Gained a solid understanding of different Python loops and how to use them effectively.
- Acquired hands-on experience working with Python dictionaries, lists, tuples, and sets.
- Learned how to apply various operations and methods for these data structures.
- Developed the ability to write clean and efficient Python code.
